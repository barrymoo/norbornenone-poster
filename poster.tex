\vspace{0.25cm}

    \bindent We use the following 3-parameter expression for the inverse
    interelectronic distance in the exchange functional
    \cite{yanai_new_2004}:
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:r12-range-separation-alpha-beta-gamma}
    \frac{1}{r_{12}} =
    \frac{\alpha + \beta \operatorname{erf} (\gamma r_{12})}{r_{12}} + 
    \frac{1-[\alpha + \beta \operatorname{erf} (\gamma r_{12})]}{r_{12}} 
    \end{equation}
    where the first term on the right-hand side is used for the long-range
    HF part. In Equation (\ref{eq:r12-range-separation-alpha-beta-gamma}),
    $\gamma$ is the range-separation parameter, $\alpha$ is the HF
    fraction at very small interelectronic distances, and $\alpha+\beta$
    quantifies the fraction of HF exchange in the asymptotic limit at
    large interelectronic separations. A global hybrid such as B3LYP
    corresponds to $\beta = 0$, with $\alpha$ being the HF fraction of
    exchange in the functional.

    \bindent We consider a range-separated hybrid variant of the PBE functional
    which satisfies the correct asymptotic behavior of the XC
    potential. It follows that $\alpha + \beta = 1$. Further, the
    functional is tuned to satisfy
    $-{\varepsilon}^{\text{HOMO}}(N)=\text{IP}(N)$ subject to the $\alpha
    + \beta = 1$ constraint. Following Reference
    \citen{kuritz_charge-transfer-like_2011}, we minimize
    \begin{equation}
    J^2 =
    \sum_{i=0}^{1} [\varepsilon^{\text{HOMO}}(N+i)+\text{IP}(N+i)]^2 
    \label{eq:J2-criterion}
    \end{equation} 
    to satisfy the IP condition simultaneously for the system with $N$ and
    $N+1$ electrons, where $\text{IP}(N)= E(N)-E(N-1)$ is calculated as a
    difference of total energies. This optimization is performed in the
    $\alpha = 1-\beta$ vs.\ $\gamma$ plane, which is the reason why the
    procedure is referred to as a `two-dimensional' tuning here. The
    tuning was accomplished as follows. Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals
    were calculated for the neutral ($N$ electrons), anion ($N+1$), and
    cation ($N-1$) systems. These molecular orbital vectors were then used
    as initial guesses for DFT calculations with the PBE0 global hybrid
    functional. The PBE0 molecular orbital vectors were used as input for
    calculations with $\alpha$ between 0 and 0.5 and $\gamma$ between 0
    and 0.5 on the tuning grid. MOs from calculations with $\alpha = 0.5$
    and a given $\gamma$ were used as initial guesses for calculations
    with $\alpha$ ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 and the same value of $\gamma$
    in order to improve convergence of the self-consistent field (SCF)
    procedure.  Finally, for sets $\{\alpha,\beta = 1-\alpha,\gamma\}$
    satisfying the IP condition, we investigate the DFT delocalization
    error, quantified by the curvature of $E(N)$.

    coefficients of quadratic fits to $E(N)$ in the electron-deficient
    and electron-rich regime, respectively $({\Delta}N < 0$, ${\Delta}N
    > 0)$. The inset shows the $E(N)$ behavior in the electron-rich
    regime.}
